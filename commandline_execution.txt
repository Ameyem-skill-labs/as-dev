php command line execution
--------------------------


php -a
echo function_exists("foo") ? "yes" : "no";

from laravel:

php artisan make:command MyCommand

Go to /app/Console/Commands/MyCommand.php

Find:

protected $signature = 'command:name';
Change to:

protected $signature = 'my:command';
There's handle() method there you are able to fire some code:

public function handle()
{
    echo 'Hello world';
}
In the /app/Console/Kernel.php you will find protected variable $commands. Add your Command's class name.

protected $commands = [
    // ...
    Commands\MyCommand::class,
];
Run php artisan my:command
